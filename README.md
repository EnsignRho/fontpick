fontpick
========

Simple VFP9 font picker using labels which show their content in the actual fonts.  Note:  The class can be programmatically resized to hide the bottom portion until the user clicks in the input box, or begins typing, etc. This is a starting point, not necessarily a finished product. Your mileage may vary. :-)


How to
========

Download ZIP or clone locally, go to the directory, and type "do main" from VFP command prompt.  MODIFY CLASS fontline OF fontpick.vcx, and MODIFY CLASS fontpick OF fontpick.vcx get you to the bulk of the code.  There is a little code on MODIFY FORM frmSample.  The x.fontpick.txtFont object holds the font attributes that can be referenced by an external application. There is no "Select" or "Choose" button.  Whatever is there is there.
